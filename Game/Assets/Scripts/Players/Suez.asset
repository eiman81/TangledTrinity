  description: "Coming from a royal family with multiple brothers, Suez grew up in
    the arms of wealth. However, he knew he was different, he was meant for something
    else, and in his blood he felt it. There were stories about his grandpa, more
    like legends; the kingdom had accused him of magic and therefore banished him.
    His grandpa had become a dark spot on his family tree. One stormy night standing
    on the balcony, fed up with his father, he felt rage flowing through his veins,
    or maybe even something else. He killed his father in the heat of the moment.
    It wasn\u2019t an ordinary death, king Ramos II froze to death.  Suez was really
    confused, he saw where the ice had come from and it was the tip of his finger,
    there was a \u2026. Hole. Now his heart was beating really fast, he couldn\u2019t
    control himself and therefore jumped from the balcony into the icy mountains
    below. On the way down lightning struck him and sent a shock through his body,
    a violent knock he will never forget. His life flashed past his eyes, \u201CWhat
    life? Have I ever been alive in this prison? No amount of money can make me happy,
    I need to find my purpose!\u201D He tensed, Suez didn\u2019t want to die, not
    now, not today. He closed his eyes expecting a splat however, he slowly landed
    in the last seconds. Something about him changed. Suez felt physically and mentally
    a different person, he felt taller, he felt braver, there was a hungry glow in
    his eyes and he knew that he was destined for something greater than himself,
    but didn\u2019t yet know what. His body was perfectly fine, he looked at his
    index finger and instead of the hole, it was a whole new icy finger, and his
    right hand was glowing. That was it, he was a hero, but who is there to save,
    where is the villain? With time he knew he would find out he just needed patience\u2026.
    And some training to control his powers and use the both efficiently. It\u2019s
    a weird combination; ice and lightning, he thought, but he had to try, he was
    a god now with a new written fate; \u201CThe Tangled Trinity\u201D"
