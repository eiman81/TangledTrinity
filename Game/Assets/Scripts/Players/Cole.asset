  description: "Losing his parents at a young age, Cole was living on his own for
    a long time since. He came from a small village close to a mysterious jungle,
    where no one was allowed to step in. In all his free time he looked for ways
    to just go into the jungle once. He was a weird kid, always had severe fevers
    to the point that if you touched him your hand would burn, the village knew this
    was normal now. Just like his high temperature condition, he was also hot tempered
    and would get angry at every small thing. Cole was weirdly strong for his age
    too and had an excellent balance he used to show off in school talent shows by
    running along a tightrope, well more like a string because it was actually hard
    to see. It was surprising how the string didn\u2019t break, almost as if Cole
    was weightless. The only way village doctors could reason Cole\u2019s condition
    was by stating that all this was because of a sudden mutation of the hypothalamus
    gland (a gland controlling body temperature and appetite) at birth, however that
    didn\u2019t explain a lot of stuff happening to him on a daily basis, and one
    of the biggest mysteries of the village; Cole\u2019s parents disappeared shortly
    after his birth, they didn\u2019t leave the hospital from any exit, it\u2019s
    like they disappeared into thin air, \u201Cor maybe Cole ate them!\u201D said
    the doctor jokingly. Cole didn\u2019t see any future in the village, he was just
    going to be mocked forever if he stayed, his potential would be wasted. What
    potential, heating up, walking on a line, pull ups? He thought to himself, but
    his decision was made up, he was going to that forest even if it meant death,
    he knew he was more capable than every single person in that village to handle
    anything. He stormed towards the guards protecting the jungle (the only exit
    from the village), he couldn\u2019t control his anger, shaking and stumbling
    he felt heat coming straight from his palms. He tunnel visioned he could only
    see his palms until he made a horrible mistake. As soon as he lifted his palms
    to look at them, he felt burning like never before and passed out right in front
    of the guards. His hopes and dreams of finally getting out of this village and
    exploring the world was ruined or was it? The villagers tied him down and put
    sticks on him and put it on fire, however he didn\u2019t die and suddenly the
    mountain of sticks exploded and there he came right out of the glowing blaze
    walking slowly but with determination. Everyone was shocked, the fire had been
    going for 5 minutes. How was this kid still in one piece looking stronger and
    feeling more alive than ever? He picked up everything he needed from the village
    and made his way to the forest, this time no one stood in his way. There was
    now a burnt spot on one of his eyes, a spot that would always remind him to only
    listen to his heart and nobody else. A scar that would lead him on the journey
    to save the world and a twisted fate: The tangled trinity."
